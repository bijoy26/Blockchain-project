## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Blockchain Based E-Voting

### Physical election systems that are prevalent have several drawbacks -
- Ballots can be internally tampered before or after vote casting
- Election system does not ensure transparency and security
- Voters need to trust election authority
- Double voting issue can occur

### CryptoCast, being a blockchain based E-Voting solution, addresses these issues by adpoting following schemes -
- Each ballot is **cryptographically signed** using election authority's *private key*
- Ballots are **tamper-proof** as those are digitally signed and verified by **smart contract** on the blockchain.
- **Double voting** is addressed by keeping registered voters' data on Blockchain
- Election authority does not have access to voter's ballot
- Elligible voters can only register for the election with their _National Identification Number_.
